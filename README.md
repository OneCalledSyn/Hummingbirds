# Hummingbirds

A simple game where a human player controls a hummingbird and tries to get as much nectar from the island's flowers as possible. An AI controlled hummingbird using a trained neural net competes against the player. Each round lasts either 180 seconds or until one of the players fills their nectar gauge.
